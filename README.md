# WordGuessGame

What the project does:
This is the classic "hangman" game, in which the player guesses letters for a word that is randomly chosen by the computer. This specific version of the game has a theme of "one-name wonders," which are singers who are famous by one name only. 

How it works:
The player types the guessed letter on the keyboard and the computer will fill in that letter if it is part of the word or put the letter in the "guessed letter" bank, which means it's not a letter in the word and the user cannot guess it again.

Why the project is useful:
It's a simple JavaScript game that might help newcomers understand how JavaScript works.
